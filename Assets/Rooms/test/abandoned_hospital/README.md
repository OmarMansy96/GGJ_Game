**Abandoned Hospital – PS1 Low Poly Asset Pack**



Thank you for checking out this asset pack!

This project contains low-poly, PS1-style hospital props, perfect for horror games, retro environments, survival projects, and experimental indie titles.



Everything is optimized for real-time use and intended to evoke the style of early PlayStation survival horror games.



**License**



You may use these assets in both commercial and non-commercial projects.

Attribution is appreciated but not required.



You cannot resell the assets as-is or claim authorship of the original models.



**Support the Artist**



This pack is free, because I want beginners, students, and indie devs to have assets they can use right away. If this helps your project or saves you time, please consider supporting me.



I’m currently saving to purchase the Maya Indie license ($220 USD) so I can continue improving my workflow and creating more packs like this.



Every donation, no matter the amount, helps a lot.

Thank you for supporting my work!
